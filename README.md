### Goal

The goal for this project is to create a desktop application on which you can play the game of Tic-Tac-Toe. The game
should be able to be played by 2 AIs, an AI and a human, or 2 humans. The user can use the GUI to first select who are
playing, or use the menu item to select who is playing. If a human is playing, they can click on a field to make a move
and the AIs will play automatically. On the bottom side of the screen the current state of the game is displayed.
